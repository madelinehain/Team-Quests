# HTML -> Node Server -> ESP32

## Node Server
"Q4_Server.js" is the node server (@ ServerIP:8080)

## HTML Page
"Q4_Web_Start_Stop.html" is the HTML page. It allows the user to wirelessly click a button to start or stop the buggy.

## jQuery
"jQuery_File" is a folder which contains "jquery-3.6.4.js", a local file to load jQuery without internet access. This is needed because in many of the ethernet ports around BU there is no wifi for the router.
